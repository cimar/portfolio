<h1>My name is <a href="#">Rosie Cima</a>. I'm a journalist specializing in <em>data journalism</em>.</h1>

<p>I research stories using code and databases, then I make data visualizations and interactive graphics to help tell these stories. I also interview people and write articles and essays.</p>

<p>Currently, I am the Knight Data Journalism Fellow at the <a href="">Center for Public Integrity</a>. I used to work as a staff writer at <a href="">Priceonomics</a>, and as a politics blogger at <a href="">MapLight</a>. Other outlets that have published my work include: <em>Vox, The Washington Post, The L.A. Times,</em> and <em>The Pudding</em>.</p>

<p>I have my M.A. in Journalism ('12) and my B.S. in Symbolic Systems ('11), both from Stanford University.</p>

<p>Check out my blog for <a href="">recent work</a> and <a href="">work in progress</a>. For the crate-diggers out there, I have an (almost) comprehensive <a href="clips.html">clip list</a>.
